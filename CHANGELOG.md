## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- Initial release of Skippy - Video Segment Skipper for Kodi
- Support for Matroska-style `.xml` chapter files and MPlayer-style `.edl` files
- Three skip behaviors per segment type: auto-skip, prompt user, or ignore segments
- Intelligent playback type detection (movies vs. TV episodes) using metadata and filename heuristics
- Customizable skip dialogs with four positioning options (Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Right)
- Progress bar display showing segment completion progress (toggleable in settings)
- Multiple button focus texture styles (Default, Aqua variants, Blue, Gold, etc.)
- Skip button label formatting options (Skip only, Skip + Type, Skip + Type + Duration)
- Support for nested and overlapping segments with intelligent parent-child relationship handling
- Rewind detection with user-configurable threshold to reset skip prompts on significant rewinds
- Toast notifications when no segment files are found (separate toggles for movies and TV episodes)
- Respects user dismissals - dismissed segments stay dismissed until video replay or major rewind
- Dialog dismissal handling preserves state correctly on pause/resume
- Nested segment dialog management - parent segments can reappear after nested segments end
- Debug logging toggle for detailed segment processing information
- Cross-platform compatibility tested on Android (Nvidia Shield), Linux (CoreELEC), and Windows 11
- Works with MKV and AVI video containers

### Fixed
- Skip dialogs now properly set button focus on initialization, ensuring select/ok/enter works correctly
- Missing segments toast no longer spams when video is paused
- Nested segment dialogs no longer spam after dismissal
- Dismissed segments no longer reappear on playback resume
- Parent segment dialogs correctly reappear after nested segments are handled
- Overlapping segments toast shows only once per video playback session

### Known Issues
- Video files in MP4 containers are currently not supported (Kodi limitation, not addon issue)
