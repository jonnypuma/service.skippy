# Changelog

All notable changes to Skippy will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.36] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **CoreELEC / `Invalid setting type`**: Additional avoidance of **`getSettingBool`** in **`parse_and_process_segments`** (TV local/online, **skip overlapping**). **`_addon_get_bool`** now prefers **`getSettingString`** when present; **`_get_tmdb_api_key`** and **TheMovieDB Helper** reads use **`getSettingString`** / **`_addon_get_setting_text`** to reduce Kodi’s C++ **EXCEPTION** lines during remote TV context / TMDB paths.

## [1.0.35] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Settings UI**: **TV episodes** and **Movies** segment options are merged into one **Segment sources** category. **Online APIs (TMDB)** — resolve missing ids, API key, TheMovieDB Helper — is **global** at the top (single key for both). **TV episodes** and **Movies** subsections follow with local/online/priority only. Removed duplicate **movie** TMDB setting ids; **`tv_tmdb_*`** ids remain the shared storage keys.

## [1.0.34] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Movies — segment sources** now mirrors **TV episodes** in the settings UI: added **TMDB API** subsection (**resolve missing ids**, **API key**, **use TheMovieDB Helper’s key**) with the same labels as TV. Movie-specific values are used first; empty movie fields fall back to the TV episode TMDB settings (see tooltips).

## [1.0.33] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Movie TMDB API enrichment**: When Kodi has **IMDb** but no **movie** TMDB id in `uniqueid`, Skippy now resolves **`tmdb_id`** via TMDB v3 **`/find/{imdb_id}?external_source=imdb_id`** before falling back to title search (TheIntroDB prefers `tmdb_id` when both are available).

## [1.0.32] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Save online segments to chapters.xml** (Segment Settings): when online lookup returns intro/recap data, optionally write **`filename-chapters.xml`** next to the video if **no** chapter XML exists yet (never overwrites).
- **Movies — segment sources**: separate category with **local chapter/EDL**, **online lookup (TheIntroDB only)**, and **local vs online priority** — mirrors TV behavior but does **not** use IntroDB.app (movies use **`GetMovieDetails`** + optional TMDB API resolution via the same TV TMDB API settings).

## [1.0.31] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Remote / CoreELEC**: `EXCEPTION: Invalid setting type` could still appear in `kodi.log` during TV online lookup because Kodi logs at the C++ layer when **`getSettingBool`** is used. **`_addon_get_bool`** and **`_rlog`** now read bools **only** via **`getSetting`** string parsing (no `getSettingBool`).

## [1.0.30] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Online TV lookup**: Resolve **TMDB** and **IMDb** the same way as **service.nextonlibrary** before calling **api.themoviedb.org**: **`VideoLibrary.GetTVShowDetails`** → show **`uniqueid.tmdb`** (when the episode row only has TVDB/Sonarr), **`GetEpisodeDetails`** with a **minimal** `uniqueid` query, then **infolabel** fallbacks (`ListItem`/`VideoPlayer` TMDB, `TVShowIMDBNumber` labels). TMDB HTTP enrichment remains only when ids are still missing.

## [1.0.29] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **TMDB enrichment**: Some Kodi/CoreELEC builds throw **Invalid setting type** on `getSettingBool` for newly added settings, which skipped the whole TMDB API block so **`tmdb_id` was never filled** (TheIntroDB stayed unused). Skippy now reads those bools via **`_addon_get_bool`** with a `getSetting` string fallback.

## [1.0.28] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Online TV lookup — TMDB API**: TheIntroDB and IntroDB require TMDB/IMDb-style ids ([TheIntroDB docs](https://theintrodb.org/docs), [IntroDB API](https://introdb.app/docs/api)). When Kodi’s `uniqueid` does not have them, Skippy can call **api.themoviedb.org/3** (search TV → `external_ids` → episode `external_ids`). New settings under **TV episodes — segment sources**: optional **TMDB API key**, **use TheMovieDB Helper’s key** when the field is empty (`plugin.video.themoviedb.helper`), and **Resolve missing TMDB/IMDb via TMDB API** (default on when online lookup is enabled). Request URLs log with the key redacted.

## [1.0.27] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Online TV lookup**: If `VideoLibrary.GetEpisodeDetails` still fails after the minimal property retry, **Skippy** now tries **`VideoLibrary.GetEpisodes`** with a **`path` contains** filter on the **playback filename** (and the stem), then picks the row whose **`episodeid`** matches the library id from **`Files.GetFileDetails`**. This is **Kodi JSON-RPC path matching** only — it does **not** call TMDB’s web API (unlike **plugin.video.themoviedb.helper**, which searches TMDB by title). TheIntroDB / IntroDB.app still require **TMDB/IMDb ids from Kodi’s `uniqueid`** after the episode row is found.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Online TV lookup**: On some Kodi/CoreELEC builds, **`tvshowtitle`** is not a valid `VideoLibrary.GetEpisodeDetails` property (`Invalid params` / `array element at index 6`). The request list now uses **`showtitle`** (Kodi’s Episode field for the show name). If the full field list is still rejected, a **second call** uses a minimal set (`season`, `episode`, `uniqueid`, `tvshowid`, `title`, `file`). **Library episodes** with incomplete metadata may **fill only missing** season/episode from **SxxExx in the path** (e.g. `S02E01` in the filename) when Kodi did not return season.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Online TV lookup**: `VideoLibrary.GetEpisodeDetails` **must not** include **`imdbnumber`** in the `properties` array — it is not a valid Episode field in Kodi’s JSON-RPC enum (`Invalid params` / `array element at index 3`). IMDb/TMDB come from **`uniqueid`**. **`Player.GetItem`** now uses the **same four properties** as the working toast path (`file`, `title`, `showtitle`, `episode`); when the item lacks `type`/`id`/`uniqueid`, the playing path is merged once via **`Files.GetFileDetails` → `GetEpisodeDetails`**.

## [1.0.24] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Online TV lookup**: `VideoLibrary.GetEpisodeDetails` must use Kodi’s episode field **`tvshowtitle`**, not **`showtitle`**. Requesting `showtitle` can return **empty** `episodedetails`, so the file-path fallback never enriched the item. **`Player.GetItem`** now uses the same **minimal property list** as other working code paths (no `uniqueid` / `imdbnumber` / `tvshowid` on the initial call), which avoids an empty item on some CoreELEC/Kodi builds; episode IDs are still merged via `GetEpisodeDetails`.

## [1.0.23] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Docs / logging**: Clarified that online APIs use **TMDB/IMDb from Kodi’s `uniqueid`** (via `GetEpisodeDetails` / `GetTVShowDetails`); Kodi’s internal episode id is only for library lookup. Verbose log lists `uniqueid` keys; if only **TVDB** is present, the log explains that TheIntroDB/IntroDB need TMDB/IMDb from the scraper.

## [1.0.22] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Online TV lookup**: `Player.GetItem` often returns an **empty item** for ~0.5–1s right after playback starts; remote lookup now uses **`Files.GetFileDetails` on the playing path** (then `VideoLibrary.GetEpisodeDetails`) when `GetItem` is empty, and **retries `GetItem`** with short delays. This matches Kodi behavior where toast/metadata paths succeed slightly later than the first segment parse.

## [1.0.21] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Online lookup debug**: With **verbose logging** enabled, TV remote lookup logs under the tag **`service.skippy - remote`** (playing item, resolved TV context, HTTP/API outcomes, empty responses, merged segment counts). Debug setting tooltip notes how to filter `kodi.log`.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- **Settings UI**: TV episode segment options (local files, online lookup, priority) are in their own category **“TV episodes — segment sources”** in the add-on settings sidebar, so they are not buried under the playback/dialog section.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **TV-only segment sources** (Playback behavior): use local `chapters.xml` / `.edl`, optional **online** intro/recap lookup via **TheIntroDB** and **IntroDB.app**, and **prefer local vs online** when both are enabled. Movies continue to use **local files only**.
- Online lookup uses **season/episode from Kodi** (and IDs from the library) for scanned episodes; **SxxExx in the filename/path is only used** when playback is **not** a library episode (e.g. file not in the video library).
- `remote_segment_cache` cleared on new video; episode cache key matches season/episode and IDs.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- Skip dialog font colors: `Control.setLabel` arguments now follow Kodi’s order (`textColor`, `disabledColor`, `shadowColor`, `focusedColor`). The previous order put the user’s text color into the **shadow** slot, so the outline tracked the caption color.
- Shadow uses a simple contrast rule: dark halo for light text, soft light halo for dark text.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Skip dialog mode**: **Minimal** — small corner chip (plate + single Skip control). Separate corner positions from Full mode. No progress bar, Close button, or icons in Minimal; dismiss with Back/ESC.
- **Skip dialog font color** setting (Playback behavior): named presets with ARGB `optionvalues`; colors applied in Python via `setLabel` because `$INFO` in skin `textcolor` is unreliable for WindowXML dialogs. Full mode: next-jump label control id `3011`; countdown refreshed with playback time.
- `README.md`: **Release notes** section for v1.0.17; folder tree lists `Minimal_Skip_Dialog_*.xml` skins.

### Fixed
- **Playback / segment files**: `get_video_file()` resolves the path when `Player.HasVideo` is true, not only `isPlayingVideo()`, avoiding missed `chapters.xml` / `.edl` during startup/buffering.
- **JSON-RPC `Player.GetItem`**: no longer requires `title` before using the item; file-based inference when metadata is late. Fallback playback type from resolved file path if JSON-RPC fails.
- Minimal skip dialog layout aligned to the 720p skin grid (on-screen placement; narrow chip width and right-corner inset).

### Changed
- Minimal skin templates reduced to plate + button; service patches plate image `3021` and skip button `3012` focus texture only.

## [1.0.3] - 2024-12-31

### Fixed
- Updated fanart file reference from fanart.jpg to fanart.png in addon.xml

## [1.0.2] - 2024-12-31

### Fixed
